README

Due to CORS file access issues accessing icons - html has to be run via local server

in the project folder at terminal run: 'python3 -m http.server' (no quotes)

then access html as http://localhost:8000/index.html

i.e.

run the . sh files in order from terminal run cmd:	sh runserver.sh

then either enter http://localhost:8000/index.html in open browser OR

open second new terminal and run cmd:		sh open-html-onserver.sh
